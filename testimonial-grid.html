          incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
          life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR

          "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals
          who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who
          can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were
          very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
          outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've
          often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land
          a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
